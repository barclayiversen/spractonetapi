# Spracto Net

A golang api built to help me learn go. Implements registration and login via JWT. 

#TODO
- refactor getting user id from token
- refactor repo variable to be package level scope in controllers so you don't have to redeclare
- refactor package names to reflect a more traditional MVC architecture
- implement updating a post
- implement deleting a post
- abstraction of adding the proper header was implemented as a handler func. This needs to be refactored as middleware.
